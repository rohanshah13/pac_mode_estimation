# Mode Estimation

First, use the following command to install dependencies (assuming Python 3):
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can run the code by going into the corresponding folder, and running the following commands for A1 1vr, A1 1v1, KL-SN 1v1, KL-SN 1vr, PPR 1v1 and PPR 1vr:
```
$ python3 main.py -rs 1 -pd 650_350 -d 0.01 -i 100
```
This command sets the random seed to 1, distribution to [0.65, 0.35], delta to 0.01, and iterations to 100. K is implicitly set by the distribution command (-pd). The distribution set by the -pd command must sum to 1000; if you wish to use another total, then you can do so using the -ps (population size) command. For instance,
```
$ python3 main.py -rs 1 -pd 100_10_10 -ps 120 -d 0.01 -i 100
```
Where the number set by -ps is the sum of the distribution set by -pd. Note that, for a single random seed across different algorithms, the sample history will only be the same at the first iteration.

For LUCB and KL-LUCB, only the versions for 2 parties have been implemented.

In Table 1, the results for the first 3 columns were generated by keeping random seed = 1 and iterations = 100, and for the last 3 columns by keeping iterations = 200 (except for KL-SN 1vr, which is kept at 100 iterations for all columns). The exhaustive set of arguments that the scripts can take include
```
rs - to set the random seed

ps - population size

pd - underscore separated party distribution which sums up to ps

d - mistake probability

i - number of runs to average errors and samples
```
